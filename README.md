- 👋 Hi, I’m @rmicieli
- 👀 I’m interested in dev basics although I am an experienced PM - but tackeling new stuff (in my case blockchain technology) does require some coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot. From blockchain technology (solidity) to Leading SAFe agilist, to JavaScript and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smart contracts
- 📫 How to reach me: rmicieli@mac.com
